# --- Optional: real IGES/STEP geometry support ---
# The geometry module in this app tries to import `OCP` / pythonOCC,
# and falls back to a stub cube if it's not installed.
# Getting OCC set up is platform-specific and usually easier via conda.
# On many systems there is no simple pip wheel, so we do NOT require it here.
#
# Example (CONDA, not pip):
#   conda install -c conda-forge pythonocc-core
#
# If you do manage to install an OCC binding that exposes `OCP`,
# the app will automatically start using real geometry instead of the stub.

# CadQuery provides a high‑level API for importing STEP/IGES files and
# tessellating them.  It depends on OCCT under the hood but abstracts
# away the low‑level details.  Required for the geometry service in
# FlyV0.9.5.
cadquery==2.6.1
